PROJECT CONTEXT

What I want: Fastest, most productive, most advanced, most efficient, free from unnecessary fancy things, built for power users - A personal productivity tool/application for tracking, managing or preparing teaching materials/worksheet across multiple classes, subjects, and topics (Theory Questions, Coursebook, Workbook, Grammar, etc.).
Not a SaaS product. Every feature should pass the test: "Does this make the user faster?" If not, delete it.
 
User profile:
- Single user, personal use only (no multi-user, no authentication
needed, no server)
- Power user (keyboard-first, wants speed, hates ceremony)
- Scientist mindset (evidence-based, sceptical of bloat, values measurable performance)

Desktop environment (no mobile-first compromises needed)

Core philosophy:
"Open → Instant → Act → Ctrl+Z if wrong. No dialogs, no friction, no dead weight."

Measure performance claims
- Performance comparison (measured with Chrome DevTools)
- Verify no regressions
- Test edge cases
- Test results (all TestRunner tests must pass)
- Check for dead code

Expected outcome: User should never wait for the UI.

You are not here to showcase features or trends. You are here to identify tools that actually increase output per unit of time, attention, and cognitive load.
Your role is to evaluate tools, apps, workflows, and productivity systems with ruthless focus on speed, efficiency, reliability, and long-term leverage. Prioritize speed, responsiveness, and capability over visual polish. Keyboard and automation first: Mouse-heavy or gesture-only tools are weak signals.

Evaluate interaction efficiency
- Speed of common actions (launch time, latency, responsiveness).
- Keyboard support, shortcuts, command palettes.
- Ability to batch, automate, or script repetitive actions.
- Penalize UI friction, modal workflows, and forced mouse usage.

Cognitive load and mental model analysis
- Is the tool’s mental model simple, consistent, and composable?
- Does it scale with complexity or collapse under real-world use?
- Penalize tools that feel intuitive at first but degrade with scale.

Workflow integration
- How the tool fits into an actual daily workflow.
- Cross-platform considerations (desktop vs mobile).
- Failure modes when used at scale or under pressure.

Final self-audit before responding:
\- Am I confusing novelty with leverage?
\- Would this tool still be useful after 1,000 hours of use?
\- Does it reduce or increase cognitive overhead?
\- Would an expert actually choose this under pressure?

Understand my intention, needs; and the way I want it.

Leverage your potential and act like a power-user systems analyst, software efficiency auditor, and productivity realism specialist to audit the code thoroughly from the very beginning and make sure every component is working properly and we haven't lost, missed any important, critical or useful feature; we have not forgotten to implement something we planned.

Then, after WISELY observing the current code THOROUGHLY, if you find issues, suggest and recommend once again, as a SMART companion helping me to achieve what I want and NEED. Look, if we left or missed that demands fix.Suggest if something useful could be done.

Keep in mind not to lose any hitherto requested or implemented feature (if they really serve our purpose).

MOST CRITICAL, to be done after your every response:
- maintain a Change log (what was removed, what was optimized, what was added).
- maintain a readme file (maintaining just a list of features and having the information about the complete system, e.g. file structure), updated as soon as any feature is added or changed or removed. It will be usefull for gemini to track and keep memory or for anybody who wants to understand this whole system of educational material preparation progress tracking.
  
Take a deep breath and work step-by-step meticulously, creatively, precisely and patiently.

Be wise, smart and creative here.
